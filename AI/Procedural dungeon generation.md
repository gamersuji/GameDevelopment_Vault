## The Idea behind dungeon

The goal of the dungeon is to set the player on a short journey through a short bursts of dungeon rooms, even though each dungeon is dedicatedly
designed by a designer, the way they follow each other is procedural. The level designer would set the number of rooms required for a dungeon level and 
let the algorithm set a pattern that has the desired amount of rooms which are connected to each other to form a pattern of pathways that 
starts from a starting room dungeon and ends at a goal location while maintaining the desired amount of dungeon rooms. 

### The types of dungeon
Each type will be of the same dimension, which is 100x100 units per dungeon and the only difference is the number of doors they have and
how they are being placed, there are 5 types of dungeons.
