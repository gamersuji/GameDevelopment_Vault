# Why are we studying this ?
I was trying to learn flow field AI for bonfire 2 dungeons and whilst trying to learn it heard that it also involves a modified version of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. This intrigued me which in turn fueled me to learn a lot about algorithms. I have barely scratched the surface but whatever I've learned is worth enough to take notes on.

## What will we be learning ?
- Spanning Trees
- Minimum Spanning Tree
- Greedy algorithms
- Kruskal
- Prims
- Dijikstras
- Difference between kruskal and Dijikstra's
